Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze

If you want it, take it  
I should have said it before  
Tried to hide it, fake it  
I can't pretend anymore  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
You were better, deeper  
I was under a spell  
Like a deadly fear I am, babe  
On the highway to hell  
  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am

Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
(Our love baby, oooh)  
The thought on your body  
I came alive  
It was lethal  
It was fatal  
In my dreams it felt so right  
But I woke up and pretend  
Oh baby  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more

To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasn't very long  
Was it only just a dream  
It's over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please  
  
CHORUS:  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find it's me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong  
But you pulled the string too hard  
And now we're going on our own  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Till the end  
You know I just stay a fool",

I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do

Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?

Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...

And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue

ec071df3467a412994e3f8d63670efe1,A Little Bit More,Air Supply,"For certain she was the face of springtime,  
The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

Who was she?  
  
We will never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
It was something about their hearts, you used to break  
Them, and make them go down on their knees  
On and on again  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they  
Were a single pair, not free like you  
Still they got a tragical end  
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Passion changes but they will still remember you  
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today  
  
We'll never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well known song

If they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?

You remeber leonard skinner  
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner

And the lake has alligators  
And the head coach wants no sissies  
So he reads to us from something called uylesses

Take me home, I hate granada  
Don't leave me out in the forest

Take me home, I promise I will not make noise  
Or mess the house with other boys

Who will dance on the floor in the round  
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round  
  
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene  
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one  
Who will dance on the floor in the round  
  
People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts  
And mother always told me be careful of who you love

Billie Jean is not my lover

But the kid is not my son  
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son  
  
For forty days and forty nights  
The law was on her side  
But who can stand when she's in demand  
Her schemes and plans  
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round  
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice  
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)  
  
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me  
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)  
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby  
  
People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts  
She came and stood right by me  
Just the smell of sweet perfume  
This happened much too soon  
She called me to her room

Let that rhythm get into you  
Don't try to fight it  
There ain't nothing that you can do  
Relax your mind  
Lay back and groove with mine  
You gotta feel that heat  
And we can ride the boogie  
Share that beat of love  
  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Dance you into day (sunlight)  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Rock the night away  
  
Out on the floor  
There ain't nobody there but us  
Girl when you dance  
There's a magic that must be love  
Just take it slow  
Cause we got so far to go  
You gotta feel that heat  
And we can ride the boogie  
Share that beat of love  
  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Dance you into day (sunlight)  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Rock the night away  
  
And when the groove is dead and gone (yeah)  
You know that love survives  
So we can rock forever, on  
  
I want to rock with you  
I want to groove with you  
  
I want to rock (all night) with you girl (sunlight)  
Rock with you, rock with you girl (yeah) (all night)

Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah  
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when  
I'm trying to get through  
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh  
I just want to touch you  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to touch and kiss  
And I wish that I could be with you tonight  
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I  
  
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real  
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me  
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen  
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true  
Oh baby you give me butterflies  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I just want to touch and kiss  
And I wish that I could be with you tonight  
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I  
  
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you  
Guide you to the light babe  
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you  
'Til the end of time

Boy is that girl with you  
Yes we're one and the same  
  
Now I believe in miracles  
And a miracle has happened tonight  
  
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
They print my message in the Saturday Sun  
I had to tell them I ain't second to none  
  
And I told about equality and it's true  
Either you're wrong or you're right  
  
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
I am tired of this devil  
I am tired of this stuff  
I am tired of this business  
Sew when the going gets rough  
I ain't scared of your brother  
I ain'ts scared of no sheets  
I ain't scared of nobody  
Girl when the goin' gets mean  
  
Protection  
For gangs, clubs, and nations  
Causing grief in human relations  
It's a turf war on a global scale  
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale  
See, it's not about races  
Just places  
Faces  
Where your blood comes from  
Is were your space is  
I've seen the bright get duller  
I'm not going to spend my life being a color  
  
Don't tell me you agree with me  
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye  
  
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
Ooh, ooh  
Yea, yea, yea now  
Ooh, ooh  
Yea, yea, yea now  
  
It's black, it's white  
It's tough for them to get by  
It's black, it's white, (x3) whoo",
