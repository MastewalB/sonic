ABBA,She's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

ABBA,"Andante, Andante",/a/abba/andante+andante_20002708.html,"Take it easy with me, please  
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze  
Take your time, make it slow

Just let the feeling grow  
  
Make your fingers soft and light  
Let your body be the velvet of the night  
Touch my soul, you know how

Go slowly with me now  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
I'm your song  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
  
There's a shimmer in your eyes  
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please don't talk, go on, play  
Andante, Andante  
And let me float away  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)

Ace Of Base,"Always Have, Always Will",/a/ace+of+base/always+have+always+will_20003561.html,"Always have, always will  
I was mesmerized when I first met you  
Wouldn't let myself believe  
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams  
But you didn't know  
That secret part of me  
Until we kissed an made it open up so easily  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
Everything that you give in to  
Everything you'll ever need  
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
You gotta know  
But more importantly  
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
  
Sometimes we try too hard to please  
We should let love come naturally  
And sometimes I don't know  
Just what you really do to me  
That is O.K.  
'cause it's all part of the mystery  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will

Ace Of Base,Cecilia,/a/ace+of+base/cecilia_20003562.html,"This is a song about a well-known girl  
Who was she?  
  
We will never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
It was something about their hearts, you used to break  
Them, and make them go down on their knees  
On and on again  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they  
Were a single pair, not free like you  
Still they got a tragical end  
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Passion changes but they will still remember you  
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today  
  
We'll never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
I've been trying to overcome the mental blocks I've got  
If they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?  
I wonder  
I wonder

Adam Sandler,Camp Granada,/a/adam+sandler/camp+granada_20644961.html,"Hello mudda, hello fadda  
Here I am at camp granada  
Camp is very entertaining  
They say we'll have some fun when it stops raining  
  
I went hiking with joe spivy  
He developed poison ivy  
You remeber leonard skinner  
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner  
  
All the counslers hate the waiters  
And the lake has alligators  
And the head coach wants no sissies  
So he reads to us from something called uylesses  
  
I don't want this, should I scare ya  
But my bunk mate has malaria  
You remember jeffery hardy  
They're about to organize a searching party  
  
Take me home, o mudda fudda  
Take me home, I hate granada  
Don't leave me out in the forest  
Where I might get eaten by a bear  
  
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise  
Or mess the house with other boys  
O please don't make me stay  
I've been here one whole day  
  
Dearest fadda, darling mudda  
How's my precious little brudda  
Let me come home, if you miss me  
I would even let aunt bertha hug and kiss me  
  
Wait a minute, it stopped hailing  
Guys are swimming, gals are sailing  
Playing base ball, gee that's bedda  
Mudda fudda kindly disregard this letter!

Adele,All I Ask,/a/adele/all+i+ask_21105101.html,"[Verse 1]  
I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Bridge]  
Let this be our lesson in love  
Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?

Air Supply,A Little Bit More,/a/air+supply/a+little+bit+more_21058162.html,"For certain she was the face of springtime,  
The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
Just a little bit more.

Aiza Seguerra,Fool Til The End,/a/aiza+seguerra/fool+til+the+end_20759777.html,"Before you go away  
To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasn't very long  
Was it only just a dream  
It's over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please  
  
CHORUS:  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find it's me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong  
But you pulled the string too hard  
And now we're going on our own  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Till the end  
You know I just stay a fool

This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more

Like a deadly fear I am, babe  
On the highway to hell

The thought on your body  
I came alive  
It was lethal  
It was fatal  
In my dreams it felt so right  
But I woke up and pretend  
Oh baby

This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I break free
