ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

I was mesmerized when I first met you  
Wouldn't let myself believe  
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams  
But you didn't know  
That secret part of me  
Until we kissed an made it open up so easily  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you

I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
Everything that you give in to  
Everything you'll ever need  
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
You gotta know  
But more importantly  
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
  
Sometimes we try too hard to please  
We should let love come naturally  
And sometimes I don't know  
Just what you really do to me  
That is O.K.  
'cause it's all part of the mystery  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show

Ace Of Base,Cecilia,/a/ace+of+base/cecilia_20003562.html,"This is a song about a well-known girl  
Who was she?  
  
We will never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
It was something about their hearts, you used to break  
Them, and make them go down on their knees  
On and on again  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they  
Were a single pair, not free like you  
Still they got a tragical end  
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Passion changes but they will still remember you  
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today  
  
We'll never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?

If they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?  
I wonder

Here I am at camp granada  
Camp is very entertaining  
They say we'll have some fun when it stops raining  
  
I went hiking with joe spivy  
He developed poison ivy  
You remeber leonard skinner  
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner  
  
All the counslers hate the waiters  
And the lake has alligators  
And the head coach wants no sissies  
So he reads to us from something called uylesses  
  
I don't want this, should I scare ya  
But my bunk mate has malaria  
You remember jeffery hardy  
They're about to organize a searching party  
  
Take me home, o mudda fudda  
Take me home, I hate granada  
Don't leave me out in the forest  
Where I might get eaten by a bear  
  
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise  
Or mess the house with other boys  
O please don't make me stay  
I've been here one whole day  
  
Dearest fadda, darling mudda  
How's my precious little brudda  
Let me come home, if you miss me  
I would even let aunt bertha hug and kiss me  
  
Wait a minute, it stopped hailing  
Guys are swimming, gals are sailing  
Playing base ball, gee that's bedda

So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left

Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?

Let this be the way we remember us

And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...

If this is my last night with you

The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...

You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down

We have to seize the chance  
A case of do or die  
This is our last dance  
  
A moment's hesitation and we always pay the price  
Hiding in the wings is just like walking on thin ice  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
There's an easy way to turn the page  
  
The vision is too real  
The prize is there to take  
We're on an even keel  
No demons in our way  
  
If you stack the cards you will one day find your heaven  
Both sides of the dice are always adding up to seven

Hang the banners high

The battles lost and won  
That's when the hammer falls  
  
Racing to the future we must never lose our way  
All we have to do is take tomorrow's chance today  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays have all departed

On an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep

And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly

I hold on to your body and feel each move you make  
Your voice is warm and tender a love that I could not forsake  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms  
When the world outside's too much to take  
That all ends when I'm with you  
Even though there may be times it seems I'm far away  
But never wonder where I am cause I am always by your side  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love  
The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly  
The feeling that I can't go on is light years away  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love

Va ti aspettero'  
II fiore nel giardino segna il tempo  
Qui disegnero' il giomo poi del tuo ritorno  
Sei cosi sicura del mio amore  
Da portarlo via con te  
Chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando ancora a me  
E se ti servira' lo mostri al mondo  
Che non sa che vita see'e'  
Nel cuore che distratto sembra assente  
Non sa che vita see'e'  
In quello che soltanto il cuore sente  
Non sa  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Tempo che non basta a cancellare  
Coi ricordi il desiderio che  
Resta chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando a me  
E ti accompagnera' passando le citta' da me  
Da me che sono ancora qui  
E sogno cose che non so di te  
Dove sara' che strada fara' il tuo ritorno  
Sogno  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Sogno  
Un rumore il vento che mi sveglia  
E sei gia' qua

Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were  
Oh, you and I  
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money  
What a lie, you and I  
  
[Chorus]  
What about your  
Your 10,000 promises?  
That you gave to me  
Your 10,000 promises  
That you promised me  
  
Once I could handle the truth  
When the truth was you and I  
But time after time all the  
Promises turned out to be all lies  
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money  
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)  
You and I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You said ""I'll take you back""  
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want  
10,000 more  
Oh  
  
10,000 promises yeah (oh)  
10,000 promises you gave to me  
  
Repeat chorus  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me (That you gave to me)  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me  
Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh you and I  
What a lie

Backstreet Boys,All I Have To Give,/b/backstreet+boys/all+i+have+to+give_10020848.html,"I don't know what he does to make you cry,  
But I'll be there to make you smile.  
I don't have a fancy car,  
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles.  
I don't care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know  
But if you were my girl  
I'd make it so we'd never be apart.  
  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you, but  
Love is all I have to give  
  
When you talk-does it seem like he's not  
Even listening to a word you say?  
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems  
I'll try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most?  
Does his friends get all your time?  
Baby please, I'm on my knees  
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!!  
  
To you, hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more-inside  
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love  
I have inside, I Love You  
  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give, all I can give  
Everything I have is for you  
But love is all I have to give

That they call life  
Keep tryin' to make it through that next turn  
Knuckles white and holdin' tight  
  
So here I go, taking the curve  
But I know that I'm never alone  
I think of you and how you never let me go  
  
I feel connected (connected)  
Protected (protected)  
It's like you're sitting right  
With me all the time  
You hear me (you hear me)  
You're near me (you're near me)

Connected  
  
Connected inside  
  
It's not an accident  
The time we spend apart  
But now we're so close  
That I can always find you  
Right here in my heart  
  
You've given me  
Something I need

Barbra Streisand,A Child Is Born,/b/barbra+streisand/a+child+is+born_20012958.html,"A child is born  
We've suddenly stepped through  
A thousand dolls  
A child is born  
Her chin is like mine  
But her eyes are yours  
How perfectly formed are her fingers  
So far reach, so much to know  
What words will be formed by her fingers  
We'll hold her close  
Then let her go  
How sweet to find  
A part of ourselves  
We knew nothing of  
A child is born  
A child that is born of our love
